# CoverFlow

An experimental iOS 26 SwiftUI application that displays a horizontal CoverFlow of Apple Music albums. The app requests access to your Apple Music library on launch and shows album art using a glass style UI.

* Uses `MusicKit` to fetch albums from the user's library with a catalog fallback.
* Displays album artwork in a swipeable CoverFlow carousel.
* Applies the latest iOS glass materials for a translucent look.
* No playback controls or additional chrome â€” just album covers.

This project is intended as a proof of concept and may require the latest Xcode/iOS SDKs to build.
